# gaussian-beam

Utilities for performing common laser beam computations.

This module has a several functions for generating and plotting 1D and 2D gaussian profiles, as well as other utilities which can be used for modeling ideal laser beams.


<h3>Usage<//h3>

<h4>Gaussian 1D Profile</h4>

Usage (running in jupyter console): 
```python
%run gaussian1D_profile.py
```
will produce the following plot:

![1D Gaussian Image](/images/gaussian1D_image.png)

<h4>Gaussian 2D Profile</h4>

Usage (running in jupyter console): 
```python
%run gaussian2D_profile.py
```
will produce the following plots:

![2D Gaussian lines](/images/gaussian2D_lines.png)
![2D Gaussian profile](/images/gaussian2D_image.png)
